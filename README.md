# University-Recommendation-System-using-KNeighborsClassifier-KNN-

A recommendation system that offers personalized advice to students interested in pursuing master's programs in the US. The recommendation system evaluates the studentâ€™s academic and professional profile to identify Masters programs at universities where the student has a high likelihood of acceptance, utilizing admission statistics, their desired majors, and historical data of admitted and rejected students. To achieve our goal, we needed to scrape and analyze a vast amount of data from diverse sources. Advanced data mining techniques such as machine learning algorithms and clustering have been employed to identify meaningful patterns within the data. The primary aim was to develop a dependable and efficient recommendation system that can offer tailored advice to students on which universities to apply to, making the application process less daunting and more productive.
